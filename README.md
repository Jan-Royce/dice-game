# Untitled Dice Game

_"The Die"_ is a powerful shapeshifting weapon. 
> More ideas in the future

> NOTE: Everything is subject to change

#### Dice: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20 
- Determine what weapon will be used. Each `room`, the die will be rolled.
- Start off with `D4` and can be further upgraded up to `D20`.
- Dice upgrade can be `Face(s) Upgrade`, `Die Upgrade`, `Extra Die`.
    * `Face(s) Upgrade` - Upgrade certain face/s of the die _( ie all **even/odd** faces, all multiples of **2**, etc )_. This upgrade is carried over to new faces added by a `Die Upgrade`. (or maybe not???)
    * `Die Upgrade` - Add more faces to the die _(ie D4 -> **D6**)_.
    * `Extra Die` - Add another die _( Add an extra die for a certain **weapon stat/skill(?)** )_.
- Player can have more dice. Would be used for weapon modifier/stats/skills/etc.
- Maybe a die/dice would also be used for armor/gear.
- **Yet to determine how many extra dice can be obtained.**

#### Rooms (Cards)
- `room`s will be determined by card draws. Wether it's a boss room, miniboss room, enemy wave room, treasure room, merchant room, event room etc.
- Maybe borrow some ideas from [Delve](https://blackwellwriter.itch.io/delve-a-solo-map-drawing-game). ♠, ♣, ♥ and ♦ will each determine the room type. Maybe in combination with the number as well.
- Card number will probably determine difficulty and/or amount of reward.
    - `King` - boss room
    - `Queen` - miniboss room
    - `Jack` - elite enemy room

#### Extra Ideas
- Make use of chess pieces as enemy types
- Make use of tarot cards as well
